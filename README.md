1. What is MORSE CODE:   Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters a to z, one accented Latin letter (Ã©), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. sources- datatransmission.co/news/freejak-discovers-darudes-sandstorm-is-based-on-hidden-morse-code/

2. Historical significance of morse cod: Morse code was invented in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and his assistant Alfred Vail as a means of long-distance communication. The historical context for its creation was the need for a more efficient method of sending messages over long distances, particularly for communication between locations that were not easily connected by existing technologies like the telegraph.

During this time, communication over long distances was slow and often unreliable. Morse and Vail recognized the potential of using electrical signals to transmit messages, and they developed a system using a combination of dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers. This system eventually became known as Morse code.

The invention of Morse code coincided with the development of the telegraph, which allowed messages to be sent over long distances almost instantaneously using electrical signals. Morse code provided a standardized way of encoding messages for transmission over the telegraph system, making communication faster and more reliable than ever before.

 Morse code played a crucial role in the development of telecommunications, facilitating rapid communication over long distances and laying the groundwork for future advancements in technology. sources - The Smithsonian National Museum of American History

 
 
3. Morse code uses dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Encoding: Each character (letter, number, punctuation) is assigned a unique combination of dots and dashes.
Signal Length: A "dit" is a short signal, and a "dash" is three times longer than a dit.
Spacing: Pauses are used to differentiate between parts of the code. There's a short pause between dots and dashes within a character, a longer pause between characters in a word, and an even longer pause between words.
Learning: Morse code can be learned by memorizing the dot-dash combinations for each character. However, skilled operators learn to perceive the entire code for a character as a single unit, similar to a word in spoken language.
Transmission: Morse code can be transmitted through various methods like clicks on a telegraph, tones in radio communication, or light flashes. The signal is turned on and off to represent dots, dashes, and spaces. sources - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#:~:text=Morse%20code%20is%20a%20method,system%20adopted%20for%20electrical%20telegraphy.
